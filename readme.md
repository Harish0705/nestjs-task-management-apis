## NestJs Task Management APIs with MySql ##

As part of NestJs learning, I have created these task management APIs by understanding the fundamentals of NestJs. 

1. Implemented authentication with auth module, controller, service, user entity, jwt and passport. 
2. Protected the Task route with Auth guard, and implemented CRUD operations for managing tasks. Created Task module, controller and service.
3. Used TypeORM tool to work with MySql database.
